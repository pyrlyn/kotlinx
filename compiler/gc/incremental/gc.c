// Incremental cycle collector (newkotlinc --gc=incremental): the default GC (Perceus-style RC + Bacon & Rajan
// trial deletion) with the root buffer processed in slices under a per-step time budget.
//
// A step takes buffered roots in slices of CC_SLICE and runs MarkRoots / ScanRoots / CollectRoots on each
// slice (trial deletion is correct for any subset of the candidate roots). After each slice it checks the
// budget (KX_GC_BUDGET_US, default 500 us); unprocessed roots stay buffered for the next step, which runs
// after CC_STEP_ROOTS more candidate roots. A garbage object that is still in the buffer (a later slice's
// root) is released but not freed: it is left black with count zero, exactly like rt_cc_dead, and its
// own slice frees it. Program exit and rt_gc_collect run all slices without a budget.
// Bound: one slice is atomic, so a slice whose roots reach a huge live graph can still exceed the budget;
// when the first slice of a step already does, the step finishes in one pass (as the default GC would),
// because every further slice would re-trace the same graph.
